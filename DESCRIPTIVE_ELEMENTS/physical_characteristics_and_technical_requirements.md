### REQUIRED IF APPLICABLE
The Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements is an essential field for digital collections that combines information from the EAD tag <phystech> and the Physical Access (4.2) and Technical Access (4.3) DACS fields, which are sub-fields of Conditions Governing Access. Use this field to inform researchers about the physical or technical characteristics of digital materials that will affect their ability to access them. This is especially important  for open-access collections in which users may want to interact with digital materials on their own home computers, or in cases where the storage media or format cannot be made accessible on library computers. 


Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements is also the field in which to note that users may need to contact reference staff to make use requests in advance of their visits. This is important for large, complex collections or collections with many varied software and hardware dependencies. For more complex collections where physical and/or technical requirements impact use, it is required that this field be added to the finding aid for more complete description.

If any portion of a collection contains digital material that cannot be readily accessed by researchers, then a PhysTech note must be placed at every level of the collection (ie series, box, folder, etc.) to notify researchers that this is the case. This ensures that researchers will see the requirements necessary to access material. Notation at each level could also be helpful to reference staff, as it can act as a reminder of the special requirements for serving up born-digital records. See below for note examples at each level.

### Unprocessed materials 
Collections may contain some digital media that cannot be processed. This could be due to issues with the media itself, such as damage or degradation that prevents it from being imaged. It could also be due to technological constraints, such as the lack of appropriate technology to read, transfer, or preserve certain formats in-house (for instance, SyQuest disks, data punched cards, or 8 inch floppy disks). 

If portions of the collection include media that cannot be read or transferred in-house, note that the library cannot provide access to this due to lack of required hardware. You can include the series/box/folder or use the phrase “content includes”, etc. to clarify the scope and contents of the accessible media, if known.

If a collection contains unprocessed born-digital material that will be restricted, note that the material is awaiting processing in the finding aid. Also include, “If interested in viewing this material, please contact the reference desk.”  

* Ex. **“The library cannot provide access to all media formats in Series 3: Creative Writing due to lack of required hardware. For more information, please contact the reference desk.”**  

* Ex. **“The library cannot provide access to all media formats in Series 1: Filmmaking due to lack of required hardware. Unprocessed content includes edit decision lists (EDLs) and source media files from a variety of projects spanning 2004-2008. For more information, please contact the reference desk.”**  

If materials are unprocessed due to other non-technical constraints, note this in Conditions Governing Access rather than in this field.

### Processed material that cannot be readily accessed
All files have external dependencies including the format into which a file has been encoded, the software required to render it, the operating system on which that software is able to run, or the hardware on which a particular operating system runs. Some collections may include files that have been preserved (perhaps at a bit-level) but that cannot be readily rendered or accessed by researchers because of one or more of the above dependencies. If this is the case, be sure to include a note in the finding aid explaining that the library is unable to provide access to all file formats due to lack of required hardware/software/system specifications. 

* Ex. **“Please note that the library is not able to provide access to the donor’s scheduling software, Movie Magic, due to lack of required software. If interested in viewing this material, please contact the reference desk for more information.”**

### Special instructions for viewing digital materials
If the procedure for requesting access to digital material differs in any way from the procedure for requesting paper-based collections, it is important to include this information in the finding aid. 

* Ex. **“Access to digital materials is available on-site in the Special Collections reading room. Requests to access born-digital materials must be made at least 2 days in advance. Once request has been made, please confirm viewing arrangements with Special Collections reference desk staff.**”

[14] Multiple MARC fields may be appropriate and useful for recording aspects of physical characteristics and technical requirements. The authors suggest 336 (Content Type), 337 (Media Type), 338 (Carrier Type), and 538 (System Details Note). MARC field 347 (Digital File Characteristics) may be useful for single-item digital collections or relatively homogeneous collections where it is possible to manually describe all file types and encoding formats. Note that it can become infeasible to manually record all file types and formats in repeating 347 fields for large collections with dozens or hundreds of file types. See MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data, Library of Congress: https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic.
