## Document Revision History
A draft of the Guidelines was sent out to the UC Born Digital Common Knowledge Group (CKG hereafter) for comment and feedback on May 15th, 2017. After a three week-long comment period, the document was revised to incorporate the CKG’s feedback. On June 27th, 2017 the revised draft was sent out to everyone throughout the UC system involved in collection management via CKG representatives from each campus. This three week-long comment period yielded a series of suggested revisions that were incorporated into the document. As part of these revisions, a Lightning Team was asked to develop a controlled vocabulary for commonly used born-digital source media and related terms. 

The UC Guidelines for Born-Digital Archival Description version 1.0 was passed along to the Heads of Special Collections Common Knowledge Group for final review and approval on September 11, 2017. With their approval and support this GitHub repository was created for the purpose of facilitating access to these guidelines and documenting all changes made as and when revisions occur.
